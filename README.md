This file will explain to users how to run our "Visualizing Fractals" code to generate and customize a Mandelbrot Set in pygame. Also, you will be able to look at the different Julia Sets.

Overall, with our program you can

- generate a Mandelbrot Set in pygame
- plot the corresponding Julia Set to each point on the Mandelbrot
- zoom in and out, and navigate around the pygame window with your mouse
- customize the visualization with many different settings

## What this program does

The Mandelbrot Set and the Julia Set are popular sets even outside of the mathematics field for their awe-striking aesthetics. Although intricate and complex in appearance, the Mandelbrot Set and the Julia Set follow rather simply mathematical rules. Our project was to create an interactive visualization tool that allows the user to explore the colorful depths of the Mandelbrot Set or simultaneously watch the interesting interplay between the Mandelbrot Set and Julia Set as the variables are adjusted. Overall, you can adjust the following settings:

![Settings](https://github.com/lassefschmidt/Visualizing-Fractals-Mandelbrot-and-Julia-Sets/blob/main/sample_images/Settings.PNG)

- Resolution: Size of the users pygame window
- Color Scheme: Color map for the Mandelbrot visualization
- Color Interpolation: Method by which the function travels through the selected color gradient
- Color Selection based on: Method by which colors are selected based on iteration count
- Julia Set: Julia Set inclusion in the pygame window
- Iterations: Number of times the equation runs
- Number of Colors: Number of colors included from the color map

## Basics about the Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot and Julia Sets are both generated by the equation $z_{n+1} = z_{n}^{2} + c$ where $z$ and $c$ are both complex numbers of the form $a + bi$ and $n$ is zero or a positive integer. The Mandelbrot Set studies the behavior of the function for all complex numbers $c$ when the initial value of $z_{n}$ is equal to 0. For instance, in the case of $c = 1$, the function outputs the following values:
$$0^{2} + 1 = 1$$
$$1^{2} + 1 = 2$$
$$2^{2} + 1 = 5$$
$$5^{2} + 1 = 26$$
$$26^{2} + 1 = 676$$

For the value c = 1 and for many other values of c, the absolute value of the function approximates infinity very quickly (as in within few iterations). 

For other values of c, the function stays bounded and will never approach infinity, no matter how many times the function is iterated.  For instance, $c = -1$ follows the following pattern:
$$0^{2} + (-1) = -1$$
$$-1^{2} + (-1) = 0$$
$$0^{2} + (-1) = -1$$
$$-1^{2} + (-1) = 0$$

Executing main.py with our proposed initial settings leads to this initial visualization of the Mandelbrot.

Only the black values inside the Mandelbrot are those values that never escape to infinity within the chosen threshold of iterations (in initial settings, we iterate over every point in the 2D plane 100 times). All other points are being colored by looking at either the simple or fractional number of iterations it took this point to escape.

## Basics about the Julia Set

The Julia Set concerns the same equation, except now, the value of $c$ is fixed at any complex number, and the various behaviors of $z_{n}$ values are studied.  As with the Mandelbrot Set, what is considered “in” the Julia Set and what is considered “out” of the set is determined by if the absolute value of the outputs ever escapes towards positive infinity. If the values stay bounded, they are considered “in” the set and these $c$ points of the graph are shaded.

Julia Sets exhibit widely variant behavior based on their $c$ values, but one simple rule is that for Julia Sets with $z_{n}$ values that sit inside of the Mandelbrot Set, the Julia Set will be a more robust, contiguous shape, whereas for $z_{n}$ values outside of the Mandelbrot Set, the Julia Set will be a dispersed, archipelago-like structure. After activating Julia sets with otherwise intial settings, our program will show this result (hover over Mandelbrot to see the different Julia sets at each point).

## Running the Code & Navigating the Program

1) Download and open all associated files / folders including the main, pygameGUI, fractals, and other associated init, pydoc, and pycache files
2) Run the program from the main.py file
3) In the tkinter window that opens, choose any settings and then click the "Update Fractal" button. (It is recommended to begin with default settings and then customize them later.)
4) Once the pygame window is generated, navigate around the window by:
    a) Left-clicking to zoom-in (or clicking regularly on a Mac)
    b) Right-clicking to zoom-out (or clicking with two fingers on a Mac)
    c) Clicking in locations where you would like to zoom-in and zoom-out of (i.e. the zoom will be directed to / from where the cursor is at the time of the mouse click)
5) Click the "Open Settings" button in the top left of the screen to return to the tkinter window and update your settings
6) Exit the pygame window by clicking the "Exit Game" button, closing the window, or terminating the program

## Choosing "Good" Settings

While the user is free to choose any settings he/she pleases, certain setting combinations will yield particularly fascinating results while others will cause difficulties with the program. 

The below list includes a few tips for the user to navigate the fractals but is by no means comprehensive of the various combinations of settings that can / should be chosen:

- Depending on the size of the user's computer screen, the resolution settings should be adjusted so no portion of the pygame window is displayed off the screen
- Except in instances of deep zoom and high iteration count, the user should set the Color Selection based on smoothed iteration count; however, at deep zoom, the simple iteration count will yield hyper fragmented and interesting images
- The Julia Sets are best explored from a less-deep zoom as it will be more dynamic the faster along the coordinate plane that the mouse is moving
- Depending on the computing power of the user's machine, he/she should be wary of going above an iteration count of 1000 as above that the program can run much slower as the user zooms
